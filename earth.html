            <h1>earth!</h1>
            <p>Here are 3 amazing facts about earth! </p>
             <ol>
                <li>contrary to belief the moon is not Earth's only
                    companion Cruithne is an asteroid that actually orbits the sun. 
                    Since it takes the same amount of time to orbit the sun as Earth, 
                    it looks as if Cruithne is following our planet.
                </li>
                <li>The atmosphere of Earth is divided into 6 layers
                     the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, 
                     exosphere, and ionosphere.  
                </li>
                <li>Earth isn’t perfectly round
Earth may look round but it’s actually not perfectly round. 
The planet bulges around the equator by an extra 
0.3 percent due to how it rotates about its axis.
                </li>
             </ol>
